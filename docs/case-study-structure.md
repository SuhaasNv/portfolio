# Case Study Structure

## A. Case Study Page Title + Subtitle

**Title:** SpaceFlow — Smart Workplace Platform

**Subtitle:** A system design exploration of space booking, occupancy analytics, and AI-assisted insights

**Alternative subtitle:** Learning to design systems with product intent

---

## B. Section-by-Section Outline

### 1. Overview (REQUIRED)

**What goes here:**
- 2–3 sentences: what SpaceFlow is and why it exists
- Problem statement: what workplace problem it addresses
- Scope: what this project explores (system design, product thinking, not production deployment)
- Duration/context: when and how you approached it

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate can articulate problems clearly and set appropriate scope. They understand this is a learning project, not overselling it as production work."

---

### 2. User Needs & Product Intent (REQUIRED)

**What goes here:**
- Who the users are (employees, facility managers, etc.)
- Core user needs (booking spaces, understanding occupancy, getting insights)
- Product decisions: which features to prioritize and why
- What you chose not to build and why
- How user needs shaped technical choices

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate thinks about users before architecture. They can connect product reasoning to technical decisions and make intentional trade-offs about scope."

---

### 3. System Architecture (REQUIRED)

**What goes here:**
- High-level architecture diagram (conceptual, not implementation)
- Core components: services, data stores, APIs
- Service boundaries: how you divided the system
- Data flow: how information moves through the system
- API-first thinking: how services communicate
- Modularity: how components are decoupled

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate can design systems with clear boundaries and separation of concerns. They think about scalability, maintainability, and service interactions."

---

### 4. Key Decisions & Trade-offs (REQUIRED)

**What goes here:**
- 3–5 architectural decisions you made
- For each: what you chose, why, what you sacrificed, and why that trade-off was acceptable
- Examples: database choice, API design, service boundaries, caching strategy, etc.
- Constraints you worked within (learning project, not production)

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate understands that architecture is about trade-offs, not perfect solutions. They can reason through decisions and justify choices."

---

### 5. Technical Implementation Highlights (REQUIRED)

**What goes here:**
- Technologies used (frameworks, languages, tools)
- What you actually built (prototypes, APIs, data models)
- Challenges you faced and how you solved them
- What you learned technically
- What remains conceptual vs. what you implemented

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate can execute on their designs. They're honest about what's built vs. what's designed, and they learn from implementation challenges."

---

### 6. Learnings & Reflections (REQUIRED)

**What goes here:**
- What you learned about systems design
- What you learned about product thinking
- What you'd do differently if starting over
- What questions this project raised
- How this shaped your thinking about architecture and product

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate is reflective and learns from their work. They're growing, not just executing, and they think critically about their own decisions."

---

### 7. What's Next (OPTIONAL)

**What goes here:**
- How you'd extend this if continuing
- What you'd explore next (scaling, new features, production considerations)
- What questions remain unanswered

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate thinks forward and sees projects as ongoing learning, not one-off exercises."

---

## C. Optional Sections (if space allows)

### 8. AI-Assisted Insights Deep Dive (OPTIONAL)

**What goes here:**
- How AI/ML fits into the system
- What insights the AI provides
- How AI integrates with the rest of the architecture
- Trade-offs in AI system design

**When to include:** If AI is a significant component and you want to highlight AI systems thinking.

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate understands how AI systems integrate into larger architectures, not just model training."

---

### 9. Data Model & Schema (OPTIONAL)

**What goes here:**
- Key data entities and relationships
- How data is structured
- Database design decisions

**When to include:** If data modeling is a significant part of your systems thinking.

**Recruiter signal:**
"This candidate thinks about data as a first-class concern in system design."

---

## D. Why This Structure Works for Early-Career Roles

**1. Emphasizes reasoning over execution**
- Focuses on how you think, not just what you built
- Appropriate for learning projects

**2. Shows systems thinking**
- Architecture section demonstrates design capability
- Trade-offs section shows decision-making

**3. Shows product awareness**
- User needs section connects technical work to product
- Product intent section shows you think about why, not just how

**4. Honest about scope**
- Doesn't oversell as production work
- Clear about learning focus

**5. Demonstrates growth mindset**
- Learnings section shows reflection
- What's next shows forward thinking

**6. Scannable structure**
- Clear sections allow quick navigation
- Recruiters can jump to what matters

**7. Reusable template**
- Same structure works for AI Knowledge Assistant
- Consistent format across case studies

**8. Appropriate depth**
- Deep enough to show thinking
- Not so long that recruiters skip it

## Additional Notes

**Length guidance:**
- Total reading time: 2–3 minutes
- Overview: 2–3 sentences
- Each required section: 2–4 paragraphs
- Optional sections: 1–2 paragraphs each

**Tone:**
- Confident but reflective
- Learning-focused, not apologetic
- Technical but accessible
- Product-aware but not claiming PM expertise

**Visual elements (to be designed later):**
- Architecture diagram (conceptual)
- Data flow diagram (if relevant)
- Service boundary diagram (if relevant)

**This structure positions you as:** A systems engineer who thinks through architecture with product intent, learns from their work, and makes intentional trade-offs—exactly what early-career roles need.
