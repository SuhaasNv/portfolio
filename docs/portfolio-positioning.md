## Canonical Positioning

Systems engineer with product intent, learning to connect architecture, AI systems, and user needs.

## Primary Positioning Statement

I design and build systems with product intent. My work sits at the intersection of systems architecture, AI systems, and user-centered design—where I am learning to make technical decisions that serve real needs.

## Secondary Positioning

A systems engineer who thinks like a product builder.

Growing toward translating user needs into architectural decisions and product outcomes.

## What I Explicitly Avoid Claiming

- Senior or expert-level experience

- Large-scale production ownership

- Team leadership or management

- Unverifiable metrics or exaggerated impact

- Formal product manager role ownership

## Portfolio Purpose

To demonstrate that I can reason through systems architecture and product decisions with rigor, showing how technical depth and product thinking come together in practice.
