# About Section Copy

I approach problems through systems architecture and product reasoning. I focus on how technical decisions affect user outcomes, not just whether something can be built. My M.Tech coursework at the National University of Singapore emphasizes architectural reasoning—evaluating trade-offs, scalability, and maintainability—while my exposure to product management and design has shaped how I think about user needs and constraints.

I use projects as learning experiments in decision-making. Rather than building features in isolation, I focus on understanding trade-offs, system boundaries, and long-term implications. When working with AI systems or data pipelines, I ask questions like: What problem does this solve? How does the architecture support it? What happens as it scales? This helps me develop structured thinking around complexity, not just implementation.

I'm interested in early-career roles where I can apply systems thinking to product problems—teams that value architectural rigor and user-centered reasoning. I want to learn from engineers and product leaders who make deliberate technical decisions, and contribute to systems that are both well-architected and meaningful to users.
