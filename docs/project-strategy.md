# Project Strategy & Evaluation

## Final Project List (Homepage)

**Include:**
1. **SpaceFlow — Smart Workplace Platform**
2. **AI Knowledge Assistant (RAG-based system)**

**Total: 2 projects on homepage**

**Rationale:** Two strong projects that reinforce positioning are better than diluting with weaker work. Quality over quantity.

## Case Study Projects (Deep Dive)

**Full case study pages:**
1. **SpaceFlow** (primary case study)
2. **AI Knowledge Assistant** (secondary case study)

**Both should include:**
- Problem statement and user needs
- System architecture (diagrams, component decisions)
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Product reasoning (why these features, not others)
- Implementation challenges and learnings
- What you'd do differently

**Rationale:** These best demonstrate systems thinking, architectural reasoning, and product awareness. Deep case studies show depth of thought.

## Projects to Remove or De-emphasize (with reasons)

**Remove from homepage:**
1. **Plant Leaf Disease Detection**
   - **Why:** Unless it includes production architecture, deployment pipelines, or product thinking, it reads as a tutorial ML project. If it's just model training, it doesn't signal systems thinking.

2. **Any tutorial-level projects** (weather app, todo app, portfolio website itself, etc.)
   - **Why:** These signal "I can follow tutorials," not systems reasoning or product thinking. They weaken positioning.

**Optional:**
- If Plant Leaf Disease Detection includes systems architecture (data pipelines, API design, deployment, monitoring), consider a brief mention in a "Smaller Experiments" section, not a main project.

## Display Order (with justification)

**Order:**
1. **SpaceFlow — Smart Workplace Platform** (first)
2. **AI Knowledge Assistant** (second)

**Justification:**
- **SpaceFlow first:** Combines system design and product exploration, directly aligns with positioning, shows architectural reasoning, and demonstrates product awareness.
- **AI Knowledge Assistant second:** Shows AI systems depth (RAG architecture), reinforces technical capability, and demonstrates systems thinking applied to AI.

**Why this order:**
- SpaceFlow is the strongest signal of product-minded systems engineering.
- AI Knowledge Assistant reinforces technical depth.
- Together they show breadth (product + systems) and depth (AI systems).

## Recruiter Signal Summary (1–2 lines per project)

### SpaceFlow — Smart Workplace Platform
**Signals:** "This candidate thinks through system architecture with product intent—they understand how technical decisions serve user needs and can reason about scalability, trade-offs, and user value simultaneously."

**Why it works:** Combines systems thinking and product exploration, showing you can connect architecture to outcomes.

### AI Knowledge Assistant (RAG-based system)
**Signals:** "This candidate understands AI systems architecture beyond model training—they can design RAG pipelines, reason about retrieval strategies, and think through the systems that make AI applications work."

**Why it works:** RAG requires architectural reasoning (retrieval, embedding, vector stores, orchestration), not just model usage. Shows systems depth in AI.

### Plant Leaf Disease Detection (if included)
**Signals:** "This candidate can train ML models" — which is a weak signal for systems engineering roles.

**Why it's weak:** Unless it includes production architecture, it reads as a tutorial project and doesn't demonstrate systems thinking or product reasoning.

## Additional Recommendations

**If you only have 2 strong projects:**
- This is fine for early-career. Better to show 2 strong projects than 5 weak ones.
- Frame them as deep learning experiments, not a lack of work.

**If you want to show breadth:**
- Add a small "Other Experiments" section (below the fold) with 1–2 sentence descriptions of smaller projects, but don't give them equal weight.

**What to emphasize in case studies:**
- **Architectural decisions:** Why this design, not that one?
- **Trade-offs:** What did you sacrifice and why?
- **Product reasoning:** How did user needs shape technical choices?
- **Learning:** What would you do differently?

**Bottom line:** Two strong projects that demonstrate systems thinking and product awareness are more valuable than a longer list that includes tutorial-level work. Focus on depth of reasoning, not quantity of features.
