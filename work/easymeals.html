        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Context & Problem</h2>
            
            <p>This case study was developed as part of the <strong>Designing and Managing Products and Platforms</strong> course at NUS on January 15, 2026, led by faculty member <strong>Scott Si</strong>. The course focused on applying design thinking methodologies to real-world product challenges. This exercise emphasized structured problem-solving, user-centered design, and business reasoning—core skills for product management.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Busy working professionals struggle to maintain healthy eating habits due to time constraints. The gap between wanting to eat well and having the time to plan, shop, and prepare nutritious meals creates a persistent pain point that affects both physical health and daily productivity.</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Problem Matters</h3>
            <p>Poor nutrition among working professionals has measurable impacts: decreased energy levels, reduced productivity, and long-term health risks. Existing solutions (meal prep services, restaurant delivery, grocery delivery) either require significant time investment or compromise on nutritional quality. There's a clear opportunity for a solution that removes the time barrier while maintaining nutritional standards.</p>

            <h3>Research Planning</h3>
            <p>Before conducting research, we developed a structured research plan to ensure we gathered meaningful insights. The plan outlined our research objectives, target user segments, interview questions, and methods for synthesizing findings. This upfront planning helped us stay focused on understanding the core problem rather than getting lost in surface-level symptoms.</p>

            <h3>How Insights Were Gathered</h3>
            <p>Through structured interviews and empathy mapping exercises, we engaged with working professionals across different industries. The research focused on understanding daily routines, pain points around meal planning, and existing coping strategies.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Pain Points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time scarcity:</strong> Planning meals, grocery shopping, and cooking compete with work demands and personal time</li>
                <li><strong>Decision fatigue:</strong> Constant choices about what to eat drain mental energy</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional knowledge gap:</strong> Uncertainty about what constitutes a balanced meal for their lifestyle</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent habits:</strong> Good intentions don't translate to consistent behavior due to lack of structure</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Core Insight</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The real barrier isn't cost or preference—it's cognitive load.</strong> Professionals want healthy meals but need a system that removes the mental overhead of planning and decision-making. They're willing to pay for convenience if it delivers consistent, high-quality nutrition without requiring their time or attention.</p>

        <!-- Problem Reframing -->
        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Problem Reframing (HMW)</h2>
            
            <h3>Framing the Problem</h3>
            <p>Before developing solutions, we spent time reframing the problem from multiple angles. This process involved examining the problem from different perspectives: the user's perspective, the business perspective, and the system perspective. By framing the problem correctly, we ensured that our solutions would address root causes rather than symptoms.</p>

            <h3>Final How Might We Statement</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>How might we help busy professionals maintain consistent, healthy eating habits without requiring time for meal planning or cooking?</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Why This Framing Was Chosen</h3>
            <p>This HMW statement focuses on the core constraint (time) while leaving room for multiple solution approaches. It emphasizes outcomes (consistent, healthy eating) rather than prescribing a specific solution type. The framing also acknowledges that the target users are willing to invest resources (money) but not time—a critical distinction for business model design.</p>

        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Ideation & Exploration</h2>
            
            <p>We generated multiple solution concepts through structured brainstorming sessions, exploring different approaches to addressing the core problem:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meal kit delivery:</strong> Pre-portioned ingredients with recipes (deprioritized due to still requiring cooking time)</li>
                <li><strong>AI meal planner:</strong> Personalized meal plans with automated grocery lists (deprioritized due to complexity and still requiring shopping/cooking)</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurant partnership platform:</strong> Curated healthy options from local restaurants (deprioritized due to quality control challenges and higher costs)</li>
                <li><strong>Ready-to-eat meal delivery:</strong> Fully prepared, nutritionally balanced meals delivered on schedule (selected as primary solution)</li>
                <li><strong>In-app fitness integration:</strong> Connect meal recommendations with fitness goals (selected as supporting feature)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Some Ideas Were Deprioritized</h3>
            <p>Ideas that still required user time (cooking, shopping) were eliminated because they didn't address the core constraint. Solutions with high operational complexity or quality control challenges were deprioritized due to feasibility concerns. The focus remained on solutions that could deliver consistent value with minimal user effort.</p>

            <h3>Impact vs Feasibility Analysis</h3>
            <p>We evaluated each solution concept using an impact-feasibility matrix:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High impact, high feasibility:</strong> Ready-to-eat meal delivery (addresses core problem directly, proven business model, clear operational path)</li>
                <li><strong>High impact, medium feasibility:</strong> Fitness integration feature (adds value but requires additional development and partnerships)</li>
                <li><strong>Medium impact, high feasibility:</strong> Meal kit delivery (easier to execute but doesn't solve time constraint)</li>
                <li><strong>Low impact, low feasibility:</strong> Complex AI planning systems (high development cost, uncertain user adoption)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Action Planning</h3>
            <p>After selecting the solution, we developed an action plan canvas to outline the implementation strategy. This plan identified key stakeholders, required resources, potential risks, success metrics, and the phased approach to bringing EasyMeals to market. The action plan helped us think through not just what to build, but how to build it systematically.</p>

            <h3>PM-Relevant Learnings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Problem framing matters:</strong> The HMW statement shaped the entire solution space. Taking time to reframe the problem correctly prevented us from building the wrong solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Constraints drive innovation:</strong> The time constraint forced us to eliminate solutions that seemed attractive but didn't address the core problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Business model is part of the product:</strong> The subscription model wasn't just a monetization strategy—it created user commitment and predictable behavior, which are product features.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting features need clear rationale:</strong> "Gym Buddy" was included because it differentiated the offering, but it needed to be clearly secondary to the core value proposition.</li>
                <li><strong>Feasibility analysis prevents over-engineering:</strong> Evaluating solutions early prevented us from pursuing technically interesting but operationally complex ideas.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What I Would Improve Next</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantitative validation:</strong> Conduct surveys to validate willingness to pay and price sensitivity before finalizing the business model</li>
                <li><strong>Operational deep-dive:</strong> Develop a more detailed operational plan including kitchen capacity, delivery logistics, and quality control processes</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> More thorough analysis of existing meal delivery services to identify specific differentiation opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>User testing:</strong> Create low-fidelity prototypes or service blueprints to test the user experience before full implementation</li>
                <li><strong>Financial modeling:</strong> Build a more detailed financial model including unit economics, customer acquisition costs, and break-even analysis</li>
